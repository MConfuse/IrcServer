# IrcServer
A Minecraft IRC Server

<h1>A small Ingame remote Chat developed for Minecraft</h1>
Does what the title says :).<br>
Originally developed as a private ingame chat between 3 Minecraft mods,
is pretty old by now but can still be rewritten at some parts and be reused.
The main problem of this system is the message format, as this was my first
attempt at a file format which becomes quickly apparent when looking at it closer :D.<br>
<br>
<strong>The documentation however is still superb :).</strong>
